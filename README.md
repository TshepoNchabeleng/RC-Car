# RC-Car Project

Remote controlled car powered by esp32 and programmed in arduinoide and c++ with
custom control logic.
This project is part of my journey into embedded systems and control engineering.

 ##features
 ** wireless control ** - Control via Wifi using a custom remote web application at the moment
 ** Custom Navigation System ** - Implements control algorithms for smooth movement.
 ** Expendable Design ** - can be upgraded/scaled with sensors, cameras, or autonomous driving.
 ** Machine Learning ** - in the future rhe car might be implement machine learning capabilities for navigation systems
                           learning from previous driving patterns to make the navigation and ride more smoothly.
 ** RTOS ** - In the future an rtos might be considered when the capabilities of the car get more complex e.g autonomous driving
               obstacle avoidance, etc
